# How To Use
To use Fabric Macros, click on the Mods button in the Main Menu/Pause screen, then click on the Fabric Macros image.

From here, you can add and delete macros, steps, and key presses.

There are also quite a few quality of life settings which allow you to calibrate the duration of each step in a macro during its first use, auto-disable on unexpected vertical movement and auto-disable on unexpected horizontal movement.
